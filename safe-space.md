Safe Space Policy
===============

Resilient Coders is dedicated to providing a harassment-free work experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, visa status, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of any Resilient Coders employees, Interns, and/or students in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in the workplace. Any individual violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the resilient coders program at the discretion of the Resilient Coders staff. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:

[Full Anti-Harassment Policy](harassment.md)

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, and/or visa status.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

### Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, Resilient Coders retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the program.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the program or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all Resilient Coders venues and Resilient Coders-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our program for everyone. We want you to be happy during our programs. People like you make our program a better place.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

### Anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous report [here](https://goo.gl/forms/y5jizzAR6zZckgYZ2).

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

### Personal Report

You can make a personal report by:

* Contacting a key staff member (contact info below).

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the program. We value your attendance.
