*You'll need to create a DigitalOcean account before you can make a droplet. There are options for the standard middle ground, high memory usage, and high CPU usage. The prices for droplet sizes range from $5/mo to $1280/mo.*

1. Select "Create Droplet", then under "Choose an image" select "one-click apps" and choose Wordpress 4.8 on 16.04.
  - For the Wordpress Roots provisioning, select Ubuntu 16.04.2 x64 on "Distribution".
2. Choose a size plan based on your needs.
3. Choose a datacenter region. It is recommended you choose one in the United States; the number doesn't matter.
  - Optional: Add an SSH key. See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
